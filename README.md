## API 

- Servers often provide programmable interface to their services.

   - An API is a set of functions and protocols that clients can use.
   - A server-side web API is a set of web services or web resources to enable programmers to build web applications.
   - Sometimes, programmers use multiple server-side web APIs to create combined web applications called mashups.
   - For example.programmers might use the APIs of Spotify and Google Maps to build a mashup website that combines a music playing application with an interactive map.

## HTTP request methods
- HTTP uses a common set of actions:
   - GET - request data from a source (SQL - INSERT)
   - POST - submit data to be processed (SQL - SELECT)
   - PUT - uploads a new resource to the server (SQL - UPDATE)
   - DELETE - removes a resource from the server (SQL - DELETE)
 
## Thick clients
- The easiest way of implementing a network is to use standard computers as hosts and join them via a network medium
  - Each host on the network would be a powerful computer in its own right
  - Unfortunately this power is relatively expensive and each node needs to be admininstered indiviudally.
