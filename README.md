# Client-server-and-Peer-to-Peer-Networks

## Client-server networking

- In a client-server network, one or more central servers provide services to the clients on
the network. Servers are connected to the network in the same way as clients, but are
often more powerful machines than the clients. 

- The clients on the network request services from the servers, which then respond to the
client with the requested service. Services provided by servers in a client-server network
could include file storage as well as management of emails, user accounts and print
queues. 

- Most schools, colleges and businesses use client-server networks to allow for central 
management of clients on the network. This can improve security but requires a fair
degree of expertise to set up and manage. 

## Peer-to-Peer networking

- Peer-to-peer networks do away with a shared server. Instead, services are provided by the 
clients themselves and every client has equal status. For example, one computer on the
network might manage print queues, another manage storage and a third manage emails.

- The primary disadvantage of peer-to-peer networking is that all of the clients which provide
services must be running in order for the network to be fully operational. If the computer
responsible for managing storage is turned off or faulty, none of the clients on the network
can access their files. 

- On the other hand, peer-to-peer networking is more cost effective than client-server 
networking as there is no need for a powerful server to provide services. Furthermore, 
peer-to-peer networks are easier to set up and maintain than their client-server 
counterparts 

- Large file-sharing networks and multimedia providers use peer-to-peer networking to
provide high-performance services without the requirement for a server.


## API 

- Servers often provide programmable interface to their services.

   - An API is a set of functions and protocols that clients can use.
   - A server-side web API is a set of web services or web resources to enable programmers to build web applications.
   - Sometimes, programmers use multiple server-side web APIs to create combined web applications called mashups.
   - For example.programmers might use the APIs of Spotify and Google Maps to build a mashup website that combines a music playing application with an interactive map.

## HTTP request methods
- HTTP uses a common set of actions:
   - GET - request data from a source (SQL - INSERT)
   - POST - submit data to be processed (SQL - SELECT)
   - PUT - uploads a new resource to the server (SQL - UPDATE)
   - DELETE - removes a resource from the server (SQL - DELETE)
 
## Thick clients
- The easiest way of implementing a network is to use standard computers as hosts and join them via a network medium
  - Each host on the network would be a powerful computer in its own right
  - Unfortunately this power is relatively expensive and each node needs to be admininstered indiviudally.
